# The Instagram agent skill, by NateGold

Thirteen Claude skills that help you run an Instagram account. Free, MIT
licensed, no signup, no API key, nothing to connect.

One writes your Reels from 26 hook formulas and scores the hook before you film
a single take. One finds the reels that are really working in your niche and
ranks them by how far each one beat its own account. One writes the caption and
shows you exactly what the feed displays before the "... more". One grades your
profile out of 100 and rewrites whatever lost points. One plans your week.

And one is the humanizer, which is what makes the rest worth using. It pulls
the em dashes, the AI slop words and the invisible watermark characters out of
a draft, then scores what's left on a five-check panel before you see it.

**Nothing goes live until you say yes.** These skills write. You post.

## Install

Paste this into Claude:

```
https://github.com/nategoldai/instagram-agent

Install this skill, then confirm /ig-reel works.
```

Or do it yourself, in Claude Code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nategoldai/instagram-agent.git
cp -r instagram-agent/skills/ig-* ~/.claude/skills/
```

Or as a plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add nategoldai/instagram-agent
/plugin install instagram-agent
```

Want it for one project only? Copy the same folders into that repo's
`.claude/skills/`. Not using Claude Code? Paste any single `SKILL.md` at the
start of a chat and it works as a mode. You lose the five Python tools, which
are most of the value of `/ig-reel` and `/ig-human`, but everything else works.

Next, spend ten minutes on `templates/voice.md`. Copy it to
`~/.claude/instagram/voice.md` and fill it in, or send Claude three of your own
reels and say "write my voice.md from these". Every skill reads that file, and
it matters more on Instagram than anywhere else, because you have to say the
words out loud.

## The 13 skills

| command | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `/ig-reel` | Turns one idea into a Reel. Three hooks from [26 formulas](skills/ig-reel/hooks.json), scored, then the script, the on-screen text and a timed beat sheet. |
| `/ig-viral` | Finds what's working in your niche, ranks it against each account's own median, names the formula, and writes a swipe file. |
| `/ig-caption` | Writes and checks the caption. Shows you the 125 characters the feed displays before the tap. |
| `/ig-carousel` | Swipe posts: a cover that earns the swipe, copy for every slide, and the 1080x1350 files. |
| `/ig-story` | Your daily story sequence, which sticker does what, and a DM funnel where they reach out first. |
| `/ig-profile` | Grades your profile on a [12-part rubric](skills/ig-profile/rubric.json) out of 100, then rewrites the biggest problems first. |
| `/ig-plan` | Your week: what to post, which format, when, and 10 accounts to engage with. |
| `/ig-human` | The humanizer. Two scripts that really run. More below. |
| `/ig-comment` | Comments on other people's posts. Nine types, chosen by what the post really is. Never "🔥🔥🔥". |
| `/ig-reply` | Comments on your own posts. Sorts them into keyword / lead / substance / question / support / noise, then replies in that order. |
| `/ig-dm` | Keyword deliveries, first messages, collab pitches, and the two follow-ups. Only two. |
| `/ig-repurpose` | Turns one video, podcast or newsletter into a week of standalone reels and carousels. |
| `/ig-audit` | Reviews what you've already posted. Ranks by outlier multiple and sends per reach, not views. |

## The five tools that really run

No installs, no internet, nothing uploaded. They run on your computer, on your
own text.

### Hooks

```bash
python3 hookscore.py hooks.txt              # rank your options
python3 beats.py script.txt --target 30     # time it before you shoot it
```

```
HOOK RANKING
==============================================================================
->  85.6 STRONG  Nobody tells you that your first 30 reels are supposed to f...
        weakest: SPECIFICITY (75)
    81.4 STRONG  I lost $18,000 because of one missing contract.
        weakest: ADDRESS (70)
    54.4 OK      Stop scrolling if you want to grow on Instagram in 2026 🔥
        weakest: STAKES (70)
        dealbreaker: Opens with "stop scrolling". Asking for attention proves
                     you have not earned it.
     9.6 WEAK    Hey guys, today I wanted to talk about content strategy
        weakest: FRONTLOAD (0)
        dealbreaker: Greeting. Nobody came to the feed to be greeted.
```

`beats.py` estimates how long each line takes to say, stacks them into
timecodes, and flags the four things that kill a Reel in the edit: a hook that
runs past three seconds, a beat long enough for the viewer to leave, a run of
lines with nothing concrete in them, and no loop back to the first line.

```
BEAT SHEET  ·  73 words  ·  ~26.6s at 165 wpm  ·  target 30.0s
========================================================================
  0:00.0   2.9s  HOOK    I lost $18,000 because of one missing contract.
  0:02.9  14.6s  MID     Here is the exact clause I now put in every single...
                         ^ 14.6s on one beat
  0:17.4   2.9s          Section 4. Payment on delivery, not on approval.
  0:20.4   2.9s          Approval is a feeling. Delivery is a date.
  0:23.3   3.3s  CTA     That one word change is worth $18,000 to me.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
  - Beat 2 runs past 4s. Either split the line or change what is on screen
    inside it. A static frame is where people leave.
  - Loops: the last beat repeats "$18,000" from the hook. Second watches are
    free reach.
  - 3.5s under target. Either add 9 words or shoot it short. Short is usually
    right.
```

### The caption

```bash
python3 caption.py caption.txt --keywords "client contracts,freelance pricing"
```

Instagram gives a caption about 125 characters in the feed and hides the rest
behind a tap. Almost every caption that fails, fails there. So the first thing
this prints is that window, as a box, the way a scrolling stranger reads it:

```
  WHAT THE FEED SHOWS
  +------------------------------------------------------+
  | I lost $18,000 because of one missing clause in a    |
  | contract, and the worst part is that I had read the  |
  | thing twice before I si                              |
  +-------------------------------------------- ... more +

  PASS  LENGTH            389 / 2200 characters
  WARN  FIRST LINE        133 characters, so it gets cut at 125 mid-thought
  PASS  HOOK IS CONCRETE  2 numbers or names in the visible window
  PASS  HASHTAGS          3 tags: #freelance #contracts #agencyowner
  PASS  ONE ASK           one call to action: comment a keyword
  WARN  SEARCH TERMS      1/2 present. Missing: client contracts
```

It enforces the current hashtag cap, which is **five per post**, not thirty.
Instagram cut it on 18 December 2025.

### The humanizer

```bash
python3 humanize.py draft.txt --report      # clean it, show every change
python3 detect.py draft.txt                  # score it, five checks
python3 detect.py before.txt after.txt       # prove the delta
```

**What comes out automatically:**

- **Invisible characters.** Zero-width spaces and joiners, word joiners, soft
  hyphens, byte-order marks, Unicode tag characters, invisible separators,
  non-breaking and narrow spaces. Your keyboard does not make these. They
  survive copy-paste and they are invisible in every editor you own.
- **Typography.** Em dash to comma, en dash to hyphen, curly quotes to
  straight, ellipsis to three dots, and the orphaned punctuation that leaves.
- **The lexicon.** 154 stock words and phrases with plain-English replacements.
  The last block of it is Instagram-specific: "stop scrolling", "in today's
  video", "follow for more", "tag someone who needs this", "the algorithm
  loves", "run don't walk". It lives in
  [`slop.json`](skills/ig-human/slop.json) and it is meant to be edited.

**What gets flagged instead of fixed:** "It's not just X, it's Y", rule-of-three
triads, the video preamble, emoji bullet lists, three shouted words in a row,
hashtag walls, reflex follow bait, uniform sentence length. Changing the shape
of a sentence needs judgement, so those come back for a rewrite rather than
getting mangled by a regex.

Run against a caption written to be as bad as possible:

```
  BURSTINESS    ###################.....  78.4
  SPECIFICITY   #############...........  53.6    3.4 concrete markers per 100 words
  SLOP DENSITY  ........................   0.0    20 stock terms, 23.0 per 100 words
  FINGERPRINT   ################........  68.7    1 em dash
  VOICE         #################.......  70.0    9 structural tells
  ------------------------------------------------------------
  HUMAN SCORE   ########................  32.5   FLAGGED
```

After `humanize.py`, with the flagged structures still unrewritten:

```
  HUMAN SCORE   ###################.....  79.7   PASS    (+47.2)
```

### The swipe file

```bash
python3 swipe.py captured.tsv --out ~/.claude/instagram/swipe.md
```

Raw views are not evidence. A 2,000,000-follower account doing 400,000 views
had a quiet Tuesday. A 4,000-follower account doing 400,000 views found
something. `swipe.py` ranks on the multiple over each account's own median,
names the hook formula, and prints what separates the top third from the
bottom third.

```
SWIPE FILE  ·  4 reels  ·  4 accounts  ·  baseline: account median
==============================================================================
    60.0x  hook  57  #9  The Steal              @c                 180,000
           "steal this four line follow up it took me two years"
    37.5x  hook  86  #3  Nobody Tells You       @a                 412,000
           "nobody tells you that your first 30 reels are supposed to flop"
     1.3x  hook  13  -   unclassified           @b               1,200,000
           "in this video I am going to show you my morning routine"
```

## What the original author measured

Jake Schincariol, who built the original pack, didn't want to ship a hook
scorer just because it felt right, so he tested it. The corpus is **74 real short-form hooks**: the first three seconds
of the auto-caption track from the top eight and bottom eight performing shorts
on each of five channels, view counts from 931 to 550,000.

They are YouTube Shorts rather than Reels, because Instagram does not hand you
view counts you can collect without logging into somebody's account, and
scraping it would violate the Terms this repo tells you not to violate. The
hook grammar is the same and the sourcing is public. That is a real limitation
and it is stated here rather than buried.

**Three results, two of them uncomfortable:**

**1. It catches bad hooks well.** Against ten hooks written deliberately badly,
AUC 0.83, and nine of the ten scored below the median of the real corpus. If
your hook opens on a greeting, a preamble or nothing concrete, this tells you.

**2. It does not pick winners.** Separating a good creator's hits from that
same creator's misses: **AUC 0.56, where 0.50 is a coin flip.** Of the five
checks, only SPECIFICITY separated the bands meaningfully, by 60 points of
median. STAKES and ADDRESS had identical medians in both bands, which means on
this corpus they measured nothing.

So the honest use is: kill the obviously weak hooks before you shoot them, then
trust your own retention graph. Nothing that reads text can tell you which of
two decent hooks will travel, because that is decided by your face, your edit,
your audio and who Instagram shows it to.

**3. The formula classifier was broken and the test is what caught it.** The
`match` regexes in `hooks.json` were first written from the templates, and they
named **8%** of real hooks. People do not speak in templates. Rewriting them
against actual transcribed speech took it to **49%**, and four formulas went
into the set because they kept appearing and were not there: Contrarian Flip,
The Statistic, The Reveal, Someone Else's Result, plus The Superlative. On the
other 51% it abstains, which is correct: a lot of short-form is podcast clips
that have no hook formula at all.

One fixed bug worth naming: `SPECIFICITY` only counted digits, so "zero
dollars" and "three marketing books" scored as having nothing concrete in them.
Spoken hooks say their numbers out loud.

If you re-run this on a bigger or cleaner set and get a different answer, open
an issue. The measurement script is not in the repo because it depends
on `yt-dlp`, but the method is four lines and is written out in
[`/ig-viral`](skills/ig-viral/SKILL.md).

## The fine print, which is the honest part

**These skills do not post to Instagram.** There is a real Content Publishing
API for Professional accounts, and it needs a Meta developer app, a linked
Page, a long-lived token and app review, which is not a thing a skill can hand
you. Everything else people use to automate posting, commenting, following or
DMing is browser automation or a third-party tool, and both violate
[Instagram's Terms of Use](https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870) and get
accounts action-blocked. So every skill here ends the same way: a copy-ready
block, and you post it. That is not a limitation bolted on afterwards, it is
the design, and it is why the approval gate is real rather than a setting.

The one exception is keyword auto-replies in DMs, which Instagram supports
through its own tools and approved partners, and which only fire after somebody
comments first. `/ig-dm` says where that line is.

**`/ig-viral` reads, it does not scrape.** Ten accounts, a dozen reels each, at
human speed, with you driving your own browser. It never asks for your password
and never logs in as you. Automated collection at volume is the thing that gets
accounts restricted, and a crawler is not what this is.

**The five detection checks are local heuristics, not detector APIs.** They are
modelled on the signals public detectors key on and they run entirely on your
machine. They are not GPTZero, Originality, Copyleaks, Winston or Turnitin,
they do not call those services, and they cannot promise those verdicts. Fixing
what they measure tends to move those numbers, because they are measuring the
same underlying things. That is the whole claim. Nobody can honestly sell you
"undetectable", and anybody who does is selling you something.

**The invisible-character pass is real and it is narrow.** It removes the
zero-width and format characters that end up in generated text and survive a
copy-paste. That is a genuine, checkable fingerprint. It is not a claim about
defeating a cryptographic watermarking scheme, and this repo does not make one.

**Nothing here fabricates.** No invented metrics, clients or outcomes go under
your name. If a draft needs a number you have not given, it comes back with
`{{your number}}` in it and a flag, every time.

**Platform numbers go stale.** The hashtag cap moved from 30 to 5 in December
2025 while this repo was being written, and the linter had the old number in it
until the fact got checked. If something here contradicts what Instagram is
doing when you read it, Instagram is right.
